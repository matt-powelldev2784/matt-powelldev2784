# Matthew Powell

Iâ€™m a highly motivated software developer, with experience in JavaScript, React,
Redux, NextJs, TypeScript, NodeJS, and GIT. Dedicated to writing clean, reusable
code, and passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning. I am seeking
a career transition into software development from a background in production
management.
