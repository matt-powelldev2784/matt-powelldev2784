Iâ€™m a highly motivated software developer, with experience in JavaScript, React,
Redux, NextJs, TypeScript, NodeJS, and GIT. Dedicated to writing clean, reusable
code, and passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning. I am seeking

management.

#### NodeJs Image Library Server

<a href="https://github.com/matt-powelldev2784/AWS_EC2_Lamda_Image_Library">https://github.com/matt-powelldev2784/AWS_EC2_Lamda_Image_Library</a>

Node JS API Server built to enable a front end to serve an image library.  
Images are hosted in an AWS S3 Bucket.  
The node server is hosted in an AWS EC2 Instance.  
It uses an AWS Lamda function to generate image thumbnails.

Secure pre-signed URL's are provided to upload the images directly to AWS S3
which minimises the load on the Node Server.
