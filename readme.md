# Matthew Powell

Iâ€™m a highly motivated software developer, with experience in JavaScript, React,
Redux, React Testing Library, NextJs, TypeScript, NodeJS and GIT. Dedicated to
writing clean, reusable code, and passionate about problem-solving and
continuous learning. I'm currently attending a web development bootcamp with
Founders and Coders. I am seeking a career transition into software development
from a background in production management.
